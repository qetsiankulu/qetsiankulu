# Hi there! 👋🏾
I'm **Qetsia (kets-ee-yuh)**! 

I graduated from **UCLA** in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Cognitive Science. After I graduated, I worked for a UCLA startup called BruinShack (now UniShack). I was a UI/UX Intern for 6 months. My experience in UI/UX made me realize that I was more interested in developing apps rather than conducting user research. 

I took the first step in my programming journey by enrolling at UCLA Extension. I took classes in **Javascript**, **Java**, **C#**, **SQL**, **Python**. In December 2023, I finished my certificate in **Applications Programming** with a **4.0 GPA**.

I have completed **[Codepath](https://www.codepath.org/courses/ios-development)**'s iOS Mobile Development Pathway (Intro & Intermediate). 

Currently, I am **Computer Science Student** at ***Santa Monica College (SMC)**. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React.js** and **Next.js** during my free time.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking a class on **Data Structures and Algorithms** in Java. 

## 🚀 Skills
- 📱 Mobile Development (iOS, Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit)
