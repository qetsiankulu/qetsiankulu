# Hi there! 👋🏾
I'm **Qetsia (kets-ee-yuh)**! 

I graduated from **UCLA** in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in **Cognitive Science**. After I graduated, I worked for a UCLA startup called **BruinShack (now UniShack)**. I was a UI/UX Intern for 6 months. My experience in UI/UX made me realize that I was more interested in developing apps rather than conducting user research. 

I took the first step in my programming journey by enrolling at **UCLA Extension**. I took classes in **Javascript**, **Java**, **C#**, **SQL**, **Python**. In December 2023, I finished my certificate in **Applications Programming** with a **4.0 GPA**.

I continued with post-baccalaureate coursework in computer science at **Santa Monica College**. I took classes in **Computer Systems** and **Data Structures and Algorithms** to strengthen my fundamentals and prepare for a graduate degree. 

I have completed **[Codepath](https://www.codepath.org/courses/ios-development)**'s iOS Mobile Development Pathway (Intro & Intermediate). 

- 🏋🏾‍♀️ I'm grinding **Leetcode style** problems to bag an internship for Summer 2026! 
- 🚀 I’m leveling up my iOS development skills by building **[Afrigoal](https://github.com/qetsiankulu/afrigoal-afcon-2025)**, a fan-focused app for AFCON 2025. 
- 🌱 I’m learning **React.js** and **Next.js** by building my portfolio at **[qetsia.com](https://www.qetsia.com/)**,
