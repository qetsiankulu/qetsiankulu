# Hi there! 👋🏾
I'm **Qetsia (kets-ee-yuh)**! 

I graduated from **UCLA** in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in **Cognitive Science**. After I graduated, I worked for a UCLA startup called **BruinShack (now UniShack)**. I was a UI/UX Intern for 6 months. My experience in UI/UX made me realize that I was more interested in developing apps rather than conducting user research. 

I took the first step in my programming journey by enrolling at **UCLA Extension**. I took classes in **Javascript**, **Java**, **C#**, **SQL**, **Python**. In December 2023, I finished my certificate in **Applications Programming** with a **4.0 GPA**.

I have completed **[Codepath](https://www.codepath.org/courses/ios-development)**'s iOS Mobile Development Pathway (Intro & Intermediate). 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **React.js** and **Next.js** during my free time.
- 🚀 I’m currently leveling up my iOS development skills by building **[Afrigoal](https://github.com/qetsiankulu/afrigoal-afcon-2025)**, a fan-focused app for AFCON 2025. 

## 🔧 Skills
- 📱 Mobile Development (iOS, Swift, SwiftUI, UIKit)
- 🖥️ Web Applications (React.js, Next.js)
